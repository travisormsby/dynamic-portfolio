# dynamic-portfolio
This small web app was created to help MGIS students at the University of Minnesota create dynamic portfolios.

The idea is that you might want to present a specific subset of portfolio items to a particular potential employer.  That way you can tailor your portfolio to the particular requirements of a position.

The app works by reading information about portfolio artifacts from a json file called portfolio-content.json.  There is an example file in the repo that you can use as a template for your content.

An important, but non-obvious feature of the app is that it allows you to create URLs that will generate a page with specific skills already selected.  You can do that by putting ?skills= after the normal URL for wherever you're hosting the portfolio.html file.  After the = you should put a semicolon separated list of the skills you want to have preselected.  So to load the page with skills called GIS and JavaScript preselected, for example, the URL should end with portfolio.html?skills=GIS;JavaScript.

If you want to make changes to the look of your page, that will primarily be done with the styles.css file.  The page content is primarily generated by the scripts.js file, so you don't need to add content to the portfolio.html file.  You should, however, customize the text in the first part of the body of portfolio.html for yourself.
